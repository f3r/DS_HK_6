For example, a node with 2 members of one class, and 0 members of another class has zero impurity. A node with 1 member of one class, and one of another, however, has the highest impurity. The three most common measures of impurity are entropy, gini impurity, and classification error.

These accuracy of each rule is then evaluated to determine the order in which they should be applied. Pruning is done by removing a rule’s precondition if the accuracy of the rule improves without it.\n",
